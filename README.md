README — Aadhaar Enrolment and Update Analytics

Project Title
Unlocking Societal and Operational Insights from Aadhaar Enrolment and Update Data

Problem Statement
UIDAI Aadhaar datasets contain large volumes of enrolment and update records but are often used only for descriptive reporting. This project transforms Aadhaar enrolment and update data into actionable intelligence to support governance capacity planning welfare alignment and system improvement.

Objective
To analyse Aadhaar enrolment demographic update and biometric update datasets and extract meaningful insights that support evidence based administrative decision making.

Datasets Used
Aadhaar Enrolment Dataset
Aadhaar Demographic Update Dataset
Aadhaar Biometric Update Dataset

Key columns include date state district age group enrolments demographic update counts and biometric update counts.

What Was Done
Data cleaning preprocessing and validation
Feature engineering and metric construction
Univariate bivariate trivariate and multivariate analysis
Purpose driven visualisation and interpretation

Key Insights
Aadhaar demand is update dominant
Demand follows predictable administrative cycles
Strong regional and demographic variation exists
Child enrolments dominate indicating welfare alignment

Impact and Applicability
Supports proactive staffing service mix optimization rural outreach and risk aware capacity planning using existing UIDAI infrastructure.

Technical Implementation
Python based reproducible Jupyter Notebook
Libraries pandas numpy matplotlib scikit learn
Well structured and fully documented workflow

Reproducibility
All results can be regenerated by running the provided notebook with the supplied datasets.

Summary
The project converts Aadhaar transaction data into a scalable decision support framework for efficient and inclusive governance.
